# My LeetCode Solutions Notebook :green_book:
Tracking my LeetCode solutions here. I'll start off by using C, C++, and Python. If I'm feeling special, I'll give bash a go. As I add more programming languages to my toolkit (looking at you JS, Rust, Haskell, and Go), I'll add solutions for those here. The goal is to use LeetCode as a sharpening tool for my DS&A skills in each of those languages, and my general algorithmic thinking. I also do know MATLAB reasonably well, but that's a work-only/school-only kind of language.
